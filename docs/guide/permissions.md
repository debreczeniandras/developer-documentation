# Permissions

## Permission overview

A User by default does not have access to anything. To get access they need to inherit Roles, typically assigned to the User Group they belong to.

Each Role can contain one or more **Policies**. A Policy is a rule that gives access to a single **function** in a **module**.
For example, a `section/assign` Policy allows the User to assign content to Sections.

When you add a Policy to a Role, you can also restrict it using one or more **Limitations**.
A Policy with a Limitation will only apply when the condition in the Limitation is fulfilled.
For example, a `content/publish` Policy with a `ContentType` Limitation on the "Blog Post" Content Type will allow the User to publish only Blog Posts, and not other Content.

Note that Policies on one Role are connected with the *and* relation, not *or*,
so when Policy has more than one Limitation, all of them have to apply. See [example below](#restrict-editing-to-part-of-the-tree).

Remember that a Limitation specifies what a User *can* do, not what they *can't do*.
A `Section` Limitation, for example, *gives* the User access to the selected Section, not *prohibits* it.

See [Available Limitations](limitations.md#available-limitations) for further information.

To take effect, a Role must be assigned to a User or User Group. Every User or User Group can have many roles. A User can also belong to many groups, for example, Administrators, Editors, Subscribers.

Best practice is to avoid assigning Roles to Users directly; instead, make sure you model your content (types, structure, sections, etc.) in a way that can be reflected in generic roles. Besides being much easier to manage and keep on top of security-wise, this also makes sure your system performs best. The more Role assignments and complex Policies you add for a given User, the more complex the search/load queries powering the whole CMS will be, as they always take permissions into account.

## Permissions for custom controllers

You can control access to a custom controller by implementing the `performAccessCheck()` method.

In the following example the user does not have access to the controller unless they have the `section/view` Policy:

``` php
use eZ\Publish\Core\MVC\Symfony\Security\Authorization\Attribute;

public function performAccessCheck(): void
{
    parent:performAccessCheck();
    $this->denyAccessUnlessGranted(new Attribute('section', 'view'));
}
```

`Attribute` accepts three arguments:

- `module` is the Policy module (e.g. `content`)
- `function` is the function inside the module (e.g. `read`)
- `limitations` are optional limitations to check against. Here you can provide two keys:
    - `valueObject` is the object you want to check for, for example `ContentInfo`.
    - `targets` are a table of value objects that are the target of the operation.
    For example, to check if Content can be assigned to a Section, provide the Section as `targets`.
    `targets` accept Location, Object State and Section objects.

### Checking user access

To check if a user has access to an operation, use the `isGranted()` method.
For example, to check if Content can be assigned to a section:

``` php
$hasAccess = $this->isGranted(
    new Attribute( 'section', 'assign', array( 'valueObject' => $contentInfo, 'targets' => $section ) )
);
```

You can also use the permission resolver (`eZ\Publish\API\Repository\PermissionResolver`).
The `canUser()` method checks if the user can perform a given action with the selected object.

For example: `canUser('content', 'edit', $content, $location );`
checks the `content/edit` permission for the provided Content item at the provided Location.

### Blocking access to controller action

To block access to a specific action of the controller, add the following to the action's definition:

``` php
$this->denyAccessUnlessGranted(new Attribute('state', 'administrate'));
```
